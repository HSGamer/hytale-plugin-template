# Hytale Plugin - Maven Template

A simple Maven template to start new projects for Hytale Plugins.

## Why?

This originally was a fork of [HytaleModding's `plugin-template`](https://github.com/HytaleModding/plugin-template). But since they pushed toward Gradle, this was detached to be a standalone template.

## `hytale-manifest-maven-plugin`

This is a Maven plugin to automatically generate the `manifest.json` file from the `pom.xml` when building the artifacts.
